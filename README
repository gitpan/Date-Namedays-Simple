NAME
	Date::Namedays::Simple - A lightweight package for finding namedays for a given date

DESCRIPTION
	Install and see the man pages!
	
	Please note: this is an alpha software. VERY alpha. Even this REAMDE is unfini...
	
INSTALL
	Just the usual way... download the tarball, un-tar-gz (e.g. "tar xfvz <packagename>"), cd 
	to the directory and:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

Optionally, you can:

perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install Date::Namedays::Simple
